  I created an opensource Python clone of Bitbucket / GitHub that supports
  both Git and Mercurial. I improved hi-res graphics, added Font Awesome,
  integrated advanced Mercurial features, and designed obsolete changeset
  graphlogs.

\def\mercurial{

  I am a frequent contributor and maintain two extensions: hgsubversion and
  remotenames. I have a deep understanding of the template engine and
  changeset evolution.

    What started out with me submitting fixes and bug reports for mostly
    scientific and mathematics ports ended up with me being invited to the
    \href{http://macports.org}{MacPorts} team as a permanent member. I maintain
    220 math, science, any Python ports. In 2012, I overhauled standardizing
    compiler variants. I learned how to work with a large team and user base
    while maintaining quality software.

  \def\petscdesc{
    % 
    Initially, my work focused on integrating \petsc~on older physics-based code
    for plasma fusion simulation. Learning about library maintenance (especially
    linking issues) helped me disentangle a particularly difficult knot of 64-bit
    integers and direct solvers (e.g. \texttt{MUMPS}, \texttt{SuiteSparse}, and
    \texttt{SuperLU}). Specifically, I fixed linking with
    \texttt{METIS}/\texttt{ParMETIS} and its dependents. As my pre-doc position
    went on, this work expanded to include work on non-linear solvers, a major
    refactoring of time-stepping methods (for implementing implicit-explicit
    methods), and mentoring a student to add more options for a configuration
    parser.
