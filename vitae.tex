\section{Honorary Positions}
\label{sec:honorary-positions}

\cventry{1/2012--present}{MacPorts Team Member}{MacPorts Project}{}{\chicago}{
%
  What started out with me submitting fixes and bug reports for mostly
  scientific and mathematics ports ended up with me being invited to the
  \href{http://macports.org}{MacPorts} team as a permanent member. I now
  maintain around 90 ports and have helped overhaul standardizing compiler
  variants, something particularly helpful in the scientific computing
  community because it provides a uniform compiler suite for desired packages.

}

\cventry{8/2010--5/2012}{Computing Cluster Administrator for \xiaofan}{\iit}{\chicago}{}{
%
  Built, setup, and administrated the \dept's 128 node computing cluster with
  an Infiniband backbone for my advisor \xiaofan. This included configuring a
  job queue, installing custom MPI, writing documentation, and teaching
  research groups basics of parallel programming.
%
}

\cventry{1/2010--present}{PETSc Team Member}{\anl}{\chicago}{}{
%
  Initially, my work focused on integrating \petsc~on older physics-based code
  for plasma fusion simulation. Learning about library maintenance (especially
  linking issues) helped me disentangle a particularly difficult knot of 64-bit
  integers and direct solvers (e.g. \texttt{MUMPS}, \texttt{SuiteSparse}, and
  \texttt{SuperLU}). Specifically, I fixed linking with
  \texttt{METIS}/\texttt{ParMETIS} and its dependents. As my pre-doc position
  went on, this work expanded to include work on non-linear solvers, a major
  refactoring of time-stepping methods (for implementing implicit-explicit
  methods), and mentoring a student to add more options for a configuration
  parser.
%
}

\cventry{5/2009--present}{Vice President}{\lsmsa{} Alumni Association}{\nat}{}{
%
  Brought up-to-date this organization's technology and communication
  capabilities, thereby laying the groundwork for a successful campaign for an
  amendment of our by-laws (the first since this association's incarnation)
  that ended annual dues. Other duties include organizing teleconferences,
  interfacing with the LSMSA Foundation, and helping to lead reunion weekend.
