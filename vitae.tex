\cventry{2010--2014}{Ph.D in Mathematics}{\iit}{\chicago}{}{Dissertation:
  Efficient numerical treatment for a boundary integral method on graphic
  processors}
\cventry{2006--2009}{M.S. in Mathematics}{\lsu}{\br}{}{}
\cventry{2001--2006}{B.S. in Mathematics}{\lsu}{\br}{}{Minors:

\section{Experience}
\label{sec:experience}

\cventry{6/2013--9/2013}{Google Summer of Code Student}{Mercurial Project}{\chicago}{}{
  Accepted to work on improving the record API of Mercurial. This was a very
  educational process of learning the depths of internal Mercurial code,
  specifically the context, manifest, and localrepo objects. The biggest hurdle
  of this project was tackling refactoring the localrepo.status() and
  localrepo.commit() functions. This remains a work-in-progress to date.
}

\cventry{1/2010--5/2013}{Predoctorate Research Assistant}{\anl}{\chicago}{}{
  Worked on adding preconditioning and new mesh
  capabilities to \bout. This has been released in version 0.85.
}

\cventry{Summer 2009}{Student Co-op}{\anl}{\chicago}{}{
  Continued work with \hong~and \lois~to build extendable code in collaboration
  with LLNL physicists by adding robust PETSc solvers to \bout, a parallel edge turbulence
  framework for plasma fusion simulation. This code has been successfully integrated
  into \bout{} and has been released in version 0.7.
}

\cventry{8/2006--12/2009}{Graduate Assistant}{\lsu}{\br}{}{
  Assisted \blaise~in a graduate class on elliptic solvers and wrote
  supporting code in C/C++ using PETSc. Installation, configuration and
  administration of LDAP, http and svn servers for a cluster. General
  departmental computer support: design of a Kerberos-based authentication system.
}

\cventry{Summer 2008}{Givens Internship}{\anl}{\chicago}{}{
  Worked under \hong~and \lois~to add PETSc time-stepping and
  preconditioners to a edge plasma simulation code from LLNL.
}

\cventry{8/2007--5/2008}{Undergraduate Math Teacher}{\lsu}{\br}{}{
%
  Taught $\sim$100 students a semester College Algebra and Trigonometry as the
  teacher of record. In addition to the standard responsibilities of teaching
  (creating lesson plans, grading, etc.), this course also required mandatory
  weekly math lab participation involving modern educational software and
  forward pedagogical methods.
%
}

\cventry{Summer 2006}{Research Programmer with \blaise}{\lsu}{\br}{}{
  Wrote parallel programs using MPI and PETSc;
  structuring data, scatter and gather among processors.
}

\cventry{6/2003--8/2006}{Programmer}{Velocity Squared, LLC}{\br}{}{
  Worked with small teams to solve numerous business and technical problems. Used design
  patterns, databases, threads, security, web services, and xml.
}

\cventry{8/2001--7/2002}{Student Programmer}{Louisiana Department of Education}{\br}{}{
  Designed online web applications with extensive database access using PHP and
  created graphics for web pages. Configured hardware, installed software,
  and taught workshops on Javascript, SQL, and Adobe Photoshop 6.
}

\cventry{8/2001--5/2002}{Virtual Reality / 3D Programmer with J.~Tohline}{\lsu}{\br}{}{
  Worked with a general relativity research group that used OpenGL and
  CAVE implemented with C++ libraries to utilize virtual reality aspects of
  the SGI ImmersaDesk on modeling binary stars.
}

\cventry{8/2000--5/2001}{Database / Dynamic Web Programmer}{\lsmsa}{\nat}{}{
  Designed and implemented web-based programs for students and faculty,
  utilizing server side languages such as PHP, Java Server Pages, and Perl.
  Also wrote a complete online application for registering students for classes and seminars.
}

\cventry{8/1999--5/2000}{Web Programmer}{\lsmsa}{\nat}{}{
  Created web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for faculty, including
  graphic design and knowledge of web server maintenance.
}

\section{Honorary Positions}
\label{sec:honorary-positions}

\cventry{1/2012--present}{MacPorts Team Member}{}{}{\chicago}{
  What started out as a fork of some scientific and mathematic ports, ended up
  with me being invited to the MacPorts team as a permanent member. I now
  maintain around 90 ports and have helped overhaul standardizing compiler
  variants, something particularly helpful in the scientific computing
  community.
}

\cventry{8/2010--5/2012}{Computing Cluster Administrator}{\iit}{\chicago}{}{
  Built, setup, and administrated the \dept's 128 node computing cluster with
  an Infiniband backbone. This included configuring a job queue, installing
  custom MPI, writing documentation, and teaching research groups basics of
  parallel programming.
