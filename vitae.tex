\section{Experience}
\label{sec:experience}

\cventry{6/2013--9/2013}{Google Summer of Code Student}{Mercurial Project}{\chicago}{}{
%
  Accepted to work to improve the recording feature (arbitrary selection of
  hunks upon committing) of Mercurial. This summer program provided a great
  educational process of learning the depths of internal Mercurial code,
  specifically the \texttt{context}, \texttt{manifest}, and \texttt{localrepo}
  objects. The biggest hurdle of this project was tackling the refactoring
  needed for the \texttt{status} and \texttt{commit} functions but I made
  substantial progress on both fronts.
%
}

\cventry{1/2010--5/2013}{Predoctorate Research Assistant}{\anl}{\chicago}{}{
%
  Added framework for physics-based preconditioning, new mesh capabilities, and
  advanced time-stepping methods to \bout~(BOUndary Turbulence), a parallel
  edge turbulence framework for plasma fusion simulation. Also improved the
  build system and software organization. The majority of work was improving
  meshing capabilities to add matrix preallocation for the non-contiguous
  branch-cuts. In addition, robust and novel IMEX (implicit-explicit)
  time-stepping methods were added giving the project competitive performance
  results. Version 1.0 incorporates my work. \cite{Dudson:2012wc} }

\cventry{Summer 2009}{Student Co-op}{\anl}{\chicago}{}{
%
  Continued work with \hong~and \lois~to build extendable code in collaboration
  with LLNL physicists by adding robust PETSc solvers to \bout. This code has been
  successfully integrated into \bout~and version 0.7 incorporates my work.
%
}

\cventry{8/2006--12/2009}{Graduate Assistant}{\lsu}{\br}{}{
%
  Assisted \blaise~ by writing code, providing proofs, building and maintaining
  a cluster, and helping with some class work. One such class was a graduate
  class on elliptic solvers ($\Delta u = 0$ for convex domains) using our
  previous finite element code from the summer. This code was extended to work
  on solving edge detection problems using the Mumford-Shah functional modeled
  withe phase fields. Other duties included helping the \dept's computer
  support team in the design of a Kerberos-based authentication system for use
  with LDAP, http, and Subversion authentication.
%
}

\cventry{Summer 2008}{Givens Internship}{\anl}{\chicago}{}{
%
  Worked under \hong~and \lois~to add PETSc preconditioners to an edge plasma
  simulation code written in C++ called \bout~from LLNL.
%
}

\cventry{8/2007--5/2008}{Undergraduate Math Teacher}{\lsu}{\br}{}{
%
  Taught around 100 students a semester College Algebra and Trigonometry as the
  teacher of record. In addition to the standard responsibilities of teaching
  (creating lesson plans, grading, etc.), my duties included assisting students
  during weekly mandatory math labs that employed online educational software.
%
}

\cventry{Summer 2006}{Research Programmer with \blaise}{\lsu}{\br}{}{
%
  Wrote a finite difference and a $P_1$, $P_2$ finite element program for
  solving elliptic equations using MPI and PETSc. The finite element code used
  a custom implementation based on PETSc distributed arrays. Key concepts
  included structuring data, scatter/gather among processors, and linear
  solvers.
%
}

\cventry{6/2003--8/2006}{.NET Programmer}{Velocity Squared, LLC}{\br}{}{
%
  Worked with small teams to solve numerous business and technical problems
  with a photography and photo printing company. The main product scheduled
  photographers and allowed them to coordinate shooting a (mostly large) local
  event. Our software eased the challenge of organizing and executing photo
  shoots at multiple, distant events as well as pulling together masses of
  photos, uploading them and posting selected one automatically to a for sale
  website. Used design patterns, databases, threads, security, web services,
  and xml.
%
  \newline\newline
%
  During the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, our team volunteered to
  help the Red Cross keep track of the thousands of newly arrived storm
  refugees scattered across Baton Rouge. After a 72-hour coding sprint, we had
  a functional program but due to legal constraints nothing was ever deployed
  full scale. Learned fuzzy text searching, text indexing, and merging
  databases with high chances of collision.
%
}

\cventry{8/2001--7/2002}{PHP Programmer}{Louisiana Department of Education}{\br}{}{
%
  Designed online web applications with extensive database access using PHP and
  created graphics for web pages. Other duties included configuring hardware,
  installing software, and teaching workshops for educators on Javascript, SQL,
  and Adobe Photoshop 6.
%
}

\cventry{8/2001--5/2002}{Data Visualization Programmer with J.~Tohline}{\lsu}{\br}{}{
%
  Worked with a general relativity research group that used OpenGL and CAVE to
  implement with C++ libraries to utilize 3D aspects of the SGI ImmersaDesk on
  modeling binary stars.
%
}

\cventry{8/2000--5/2001}{Dynamic Web Programmer}{\lsmsa}{\nat}{}{
%
  Designed and implemented web-based programs for students and faculty,
  utilizing server side languages such as PHP, Java Server Pages, and Perl. My
  most important focus area was completing my Distinction namely an online
  application to register students for seminars.
%
}

\cventry{8/1999--5/2000}{Web Programmer}{\lsmsa}{\nat}{}{
%
  Created web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for faculty. Other duties
  included graphic design and knowledge of web server maintenance.
%
}

\section{Honorary Positions}
\label{sec:honorary-positions}

\cventry{1/2012--present}{MacPorts Team Member}{MacPorts Project}{}{\chicago}{
%
  What started out with me submitting fixes and bug reports for mostly
  scientific and mathematics ports ended up with me being invited to the
  MacPorts team as a permanent member. I now maintain around 90 ports and have
  helped overhaul standardizing compiler variants, something particularly
  helpful in the scientific computing community because it provides a uniform
  compiler suite for desired packages.
%
}

\cventry{8/2010--5/2012}{Computing Cluster Administrator for \xiaofan}{\iit}{\chicago}{}{
%
  Built, setup, and administrated the \dept's 128 node computing cluster with
  an Infiniband backbone for my advisor \xiaofan. This included configuring a
  job queue, installing custom MPI, writing documentation, and teaching
  research groups basics of parallel programming.
%
}

\cventry{1/2010--present}{PETSc Team Member}{\anl}{\chicago}{}{
%
  Initially, my work focused on integrating PETSc on older physics-based code
  for plasma fusion simulation. Learning about library maintenance (especially
  linking issues) helped me disentangle a particularly difficult knot of 64-bit
  integers and direct solvers (e.g. \texttt{MUMPS}, \texttt{SuiteSparse}, and
  \texttt{SuperLU}, etc.). Specifically, I fixed linking with \texttt{METIS} /
  \texttt{ParMETIS} and its dependents. As my pre-doc position went on, this
  work expanded to include some work on non-linear solvers, a major refactoring
  of time-stepping methods (for implementing implicit-explicit methods), and
  mentoring a student to add more options for a configuration parser.
%
}

\cventry{5/2009--present}{Vice President}{\lsmsa{} Alumni Association}{\nat}{}{
%
  Brought up-to-date this organization’s technology and communication
  capabilities, thereby laying the groundwork for a successful campaign for an
  amendment of our by-laws (the first since this association’s incarnation)
  that ended annual dues. Other duties include organizing teleconferences,
  interfacing with the LSMSA Foundation, and helping to lead reunion weekend.
