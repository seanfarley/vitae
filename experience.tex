    Improved the recording feature (arbitrary selection of hunks upon
    committing) of \href{http://mercurial.selenic.com}{Mercurial}. This summer
    program provided a great educational process of learning the depths of
    internal Mercurial code, specifically the
    \href{http://selenic.com/hg/file/tip/mercurial/context.py}{\texttt{context}},
    \href{http://selenic.com/hg/file/tip/mercurial/manifest.py}{\texttt{manifest}},
    and
    \href{http://selenic.com/hg/file/tip/mercurial/localrepo.py}{\texttt{localrepo}}
    objects. The biggest hurdle of this project was tackling the refactoring
    needed for the
    \href{http://selenic.com/hg/file/c38c3fdc8b93/mercurial/localrepo.py\#l1458}{\texttt{status}}
    and
    \href{http://selenic.com/hg/file/c38c3fdc8b93/mercurial/localrepo.py\#l1149}{\texttt{commit}}
    functions but I made substantial progress on both fronts.

    Added framework for physics-based preconditioning, new mesh capabilities,
    and advanced time-stepping methods to \bout~(BOUndary Turbulence), a
    parallel edge turbulence framework for plasma fusion simulation. Improved
    the build system and software organization. The majority of the work
    involved improving meshing capabilities to add matrix preallocation for the
    non-contiguous branch-cuts. In addition, robust and novel IMEX
    (implicit-explicit) time-stepping methods were added giving the project
    competitive performance results. Version 1.0 incorporates my
    work. \cite{Dudson:2012wc}

  \def\grad{
    %
    Assisted \blaise~by writing code, providing proofs, building and
    maintaining a cluster, and helping with class work. One graduate level
    class dealt with elliptic solvers ($\Delta u = 0$ for convex domains) and
    made use of finite element code we'd developed the previous summer. In
    class, we extended the code to work on solving edge detection problems
    using the Mumford-Shah functional modeled with phase fields. Other duties
    included helping the \dept's computer support team in the design of a
    Kerberos-based authentication system for use with LDAP, http, and
    Subversion authentication.

  \def\teacher{
    %
    Taught around 100 students per semester College Algebra and Trigonometry as
    the teacher of record. In addition to the standard responsibilities of
    teaching (creating lesson plans, grading, etc.), my duties included assisting
    students during weekly mandatory math labs that employed online educational
    software.

  \def\dotnet{
    %
    Worked with small teams to solve numerous business and technical problems
    with a photography and photo printing company. The main product scheduled
    photographers and allowed them to coordinate shooting a (mostly large) local
    event. Our software eased the challenge of organizing and executing photo
    shoots at multiple, distant events as well as pulling together masses of
    photos, uploading them and posting selected ones automatically to a for sale
    website. Used design patterns, databases, threads, security, web services,
    and xml.

    During the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, our team volunteered to
    help the Red Cross keep track of the thousands of newly arrived storm
    refugees scattered across Baton Rouge. After a 72-hour coding sprint, we had
    a functional program but due to legal constraints nothing was ever deployed
    full scale. The project, however, allowed me to learn fuzzy text searching,
    text indexing, and merging databases with high chances of collision.

  \def\dynweb{
    %
    Designed and implemented web-based programs for students and faculty,
    utilizing server side languages such as PHP, Java Server Pages, and Perl. My
    most important focus was completing my area of ``Distinction,'' namely an
    online application to register students for seminars.

  \def\staticweb{
    %
    Created web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for faculty. Other duties
    included graphic design and knowledge of web server maintenance.

  \def\coop{
    %
    Built extendable code in collaboration with with \hong~, \lois~, and
    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory physicists by adding robust
    \petsc~solvers to \bout. This code has been successfully integrated into
    \bout~and version 0.7 incorporates my work.

  \def\givens{
    %
    Worked under \hong~and \lois~to add \petsc~preconditioners to \bout, writing
    new code in C++.

  }

  \def\summer{
    %
    Wrote a finite difference and a $P_1$, $P_2$ finite element program for
    solving elliptic equations using MPI and \petsc. The finite element code used
    a custom implementation based on \petsc~distributed arrays. Key concepts
    included structuring data, scatter/gather among processors, and linear
    solvers.

  \def\php{
    %
    Designed online web applications with extensive database access using PHP and
    created graphics for web pages. Other duties included configuring hardware,
    installing software, and teaching workshops for educators on Javascript, SQL,
    and Adobe Photoshop 6.

  \def\viz{

    Worked with a general relativity research group that used OpenGL and CAVE to
    implement C++ libraries to utilize 3D aspects of the SGI ImmersaDesk on
    modeling binary stars.
