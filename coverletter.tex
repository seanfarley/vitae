Dear Facebook Hiring Manager,

My mentor Matt Mackall, project leader of Mercurial, recommended that I forward
my resume to you for a position on the Mercurial team. As I finish my PhD in
Applied Mathematics, I am seeking a full-time position and I feel that Iâ€™d be
an excellent candidate for it.
%
\newline\newline
%
My unique background in computational mathematics and knowledge of Mercurial
internals has prepared me well for this position. My biggest accomplishment to
date is being a frequent contributor to the Mercurial project. I am one of the
few people who have submitted patches to changeset evolution in Mercurial and
care deeply about its development.
%
\newline\newline
%
Over the last two years, I accomplished a major overhaul of the in-memory
changeset, helped improve bookmark with obsoleting behavior, extended the debug
shell to work with IPython, and added color functions to the templater. These
have all taught me how to structure my code for submission and work with an
open-source community. My familiarity with the inner workings of Mercurial and
continual contribution to the community with Mercurial extensions, IRC
participation, and advocacy will help me succeed at integrating with the
Facebook Mercurial team.
%
\newline\newline
%
My work at ANL has prepared me for real-life applications of large-scale
operations. For example, I solved partial differential equations involving
large matrices and graphs \& worked with parallel filesystems. As a
predoctorate at Argonne National Laboratory, I worked in the PETSc group of
computational scientists, primarily using C and Python.
%
\newline\newline
%
I am eager to pursue this opportunity at Facebook. The best way to contact me
to set up an interview is by email. For further information about my commit
history, please visit my website. I look forward to connecting with you.

Sincerely,\\
