Dear \company,

I'm applying for the open position of \position~which I found listed on your
site. As I finish my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, I am seeking a full-time
position. My unique background in computational mathematics and knowledge of
building and maintaining a computing cluster has prepared me well for this
position.
%
\newline\newline
%
My passion lies with bridging the gap between research and application.
Currently, that is my Ph.D on boundary integral methods. This method, unlike
sparse methods, utilize generic graphics processing units very effectively. My
mathematical education has mainly been continuous finite element methods with
some discontinuous interior penalty methods both under the direction of Susanne
Brenner. Though I come a finite element world, I have significant application
experience with finite difference and finite volume methods.
%
\newline\newline
%
My pre-doctorate work with the PETSc group led me to publish a paper on
simulating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a tokamak reactor using finite
difference / volume methods. This project scales very well to over 16,000
processors and has prepared me for real-life applications of large-scale
operations, matrices, graphs, and parallel filesystems.
%
\newline\newline
%
I am eager to pursue this opportunity at \company. The best way to contact me
to set up an interview is by email. For further information about my commit
history, please visit my website. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,\\
