Dear Facebook Hiring Manager,

My mentor Matt Mackall, project leader of Mercurial, recommended that I forward
my resume to you for a job as software engineer. As I finish my PhD, I am
seeking a full-time position and I feel that I'd be an excellent candidate for
it.

My biggest accomplishment to date is being a frequent contributor to the
Mercurial project. Over the last two years, I accomplished a major overhaul of
the in-memory changeset, helped improve bookmark with obsoleting behavior,
extended the debug shell to work with ipython, and added color functions to the
templater. These have all taught me how to structure my code for submission and
work with an open-source community. My familiarity with the inner workings of
Mercurial and continual contribution to the community with Mercurial
extensions, IRC participation, and advocacy will help me succeed at integrating
with the Facebook Mercurial team.

\newline\newline
%
As a predoctorate at Argonne National Laboratory, I worked in the
\texttt{PETSc} group of computational scientists, primarily using C and
Python. My work at ANL has prepared me for real-life applications of
large-scale operations. For example, I solved partial differential equations
involving large matrices and graphs \& worked with parallel filesystems.
%
\newline\newline
%
I am eager to pursue this opportunity. The best way to contact me to set up an
interview is by email. For further information about my commit history, please
visit my website. I look forward to connecting with you.

Sincerely,\\
