Dear Facebook Hiring Manager,

My mentor Matt Mackall, project leader of Mercurial, recommended that I forward
my resume to you for a job as software engineer. As I finish my PhD, I am
seeking a full-time position and I feel that I'd be an excellent candidate for
it.

My biggest accomplish to date has been being a solid(?) contributor to the
Mercurial project. Over the course of the last two years, I have been able to
accomplish A(templater), B(debugshell), Z(refactoring), and
C(obsolete/bookmark), which has taught me how to structure my code for
submission and with an open-source community. I believe this will help me
succeed at integrating with the Facebook Mercurial team. I became familiar with
the inner workings of Mercurial and have continually contributed to the
community with Mercurial extensions, IRC participation, and advocacy.
%
\newline\newline
%
For the last three and a half years, I've worked in the \texttt{PETSc} group of
computational scientists at Argonne National Laboratory using primarily C and
Python. My work at ANL has prepared me for real life applications of large
scale operations. For example, solving partial differential equations involving
large matrices and graphs, which sometimes required the need for parallel
filesystems.
%
\newline\newline
%
I am eager to pursue this opportunity. The best way to contact me to set up an
interview is by email. For further information about my commit history, please
visit my website. I look forward to connecting with you.

Sincerely,\\
