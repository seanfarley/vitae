Dear OSIsoft Hiring Manager,

My friend and colleague Joey Hu, a Software Developer at OSIsoft, recommended
that I forward my resume to you for a position as a Software Engineer. As I
finish my PhD in Applied Mathematics, I am seeking a full-time position and I
feel that Iâ€™d be an excellent candidate for the position.
%
\newline\newline
%
My unique background in computational mathematics and knowledge of building and
maintaining a computing cluster has prepared me well for this position. My
biggest accomplishment to date is being a frequent contributor to the PETSc
project.
%
\newline\newline
%
My work at ANL has prepared me for real-life applications of large-scale
operations. For example, I solved partial differential equations involving
large matrices and graphs \& worked with parallel filesystems. As a
predoctorate at Argonne National Laboratory, I worked in the PETSc group of
computational scientists, primarily using C and Python.
%
\newline\newline
%
I am eager to pursue this opportunity at OSIsoft. The best way to contact me to
set up an interview is by email. For further information about my commit
history, please visit my website. I look forward to connecting with you.

Sincerely,\\
\\
Sean Farley
