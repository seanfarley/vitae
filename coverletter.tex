Dear Circa Hiring Manager,

I'm applying for the open position of Backend Software Engineer which I found
listed on your site. As I finish my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, I am seeking
a full-time position. With my knowledge and experience, I believe that Iâ€™d be
an excellent candidate for the position.
%
\newline\newline
%
My unique background in computational mathematics and knowledge of building and
maintaining a computing cluster has prepared me well for this position. My
biggest accomplishment to date is being a frequent contributor to the PETSc
project.
%
\newline\newline
%
My work at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has prepared me for real-life
applications of large-scale operations. For example, I solved partial
differential equations involving large matrices and graphs \& worked with
parallel filesystems. As a predoctorate at ANL, I worked in the PETSc group of
computational scientists, primarily using C and Python.
%
\newline\newline
%
I am eager to pursue this opportunity at Circa. The best way to contact me to
set up an interview is by email. For further information about my commit
history, please visit my website. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,\\

Sean Farley
